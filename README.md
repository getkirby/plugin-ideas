# Kirby 3 Plugins 

This repo is intended as a common space for all plugin devs, to organize their v3 plugin plans and hopefully join forces if possible. 

We don't have a system for this yet. Feel free to organize yourself. If you want to join, please get in contact on Slack or via bastian@getkirby.com
